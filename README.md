[View the live site](https://cjglen.github.io/Electrify-Ms1/)

This site is built for an electric/hybrid vehicle specialist that is looking to expand its customer base, showcasing what they offer and how they are different. The site aims to be easy on the eye and simple to navigate, with the potential to be scaled up and new features added easily.

# Design

### Colours

Colours used throughout the site are:

![033249](assets/images/033249-screenshot.png "#033249")

![32e0c4](assets/images/32e0c4-screenshot.png "#32e0c4")

![dddddd](assets/images/dddddd-screenshot.png "#dddddd")

These colours are used in the logo and consistently throughout the site. I chose these colours as I feel the teal shade is on trend and goes with the modern feel and aims of the business. The blue complements the teal and gives the site a proffesional look.

Raleway is the main font throughout the site, with sans serif as the fallback option. The hex color #dddddd is used for most of the typography to complement the other colors throughout the site.
